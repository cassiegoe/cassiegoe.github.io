It specifically focuses on shootings that occurred within primary and secondary school premises during regular school hours, excluding incidents at colleges and universities. These information have been collated through the use of news articles, open-source database, reports and information from both schools and police departments. \n\n## Understanding the Crisis: The State of School Shootings\n\n```{=html}\n<iframe height=\"400\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://cassiegoe.shinyapps.io/currentsit_app/\"> </iframe>\n```\n\nOn April 20, 1999, the deadliest high school shooting occurred at that time in the United States, sparking a national debate on gun control. The Columbine High School shooting in Colorado left 15 people dead and 21 wounded. This tragic event served as a catalyst for heightened awareness and scrutiny of gun violence in schools, setting the stage for ongoing efforts to address the issue. Fast forward to the present day, the alarming rise in the number of school shootings in the United States has reached unprecedented levels, underscoring the urgent need for effective strategies to prevent these tragic incidents. In 2022 alone, the nation witnessed a staggering 46 school shootings, marking the highest number of recorded incidents since 1999. This statistic paints a grim picture of the pervasive threat of gun violence in educational settings and its devastating impact on students, teachers, and communities across the country. \n\nAccording to the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)](https://www-cdc-gov.libproxy1.nus.edu.sg/violenceprevention/firearms/firearm-research-findings.html#:~:text=Taking%20into%20account%20all%20types,19%20in%202020%20and%202021.), gun-related injuries have emerged as the leading cause of death among children and teens in the US. However, beyond the physical injuries, these incidents also inflict long-lasting psychological trauma on students who have directly experienced a school shooting. The prevalence of anxiety and trauma stemming from the threat of school shootings has not only compromised the well-being of students but also disrupted their academic learning through increased absenteeism and decline in students’ academic performance following such incidents.\n\n(CHOROPLETH of shootings) (DONE)\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nWarning: package 'plotly' was built under R version 4.3.3\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nLoading required package: ggplot2\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nWarning: package 'ggplot2' was built under R version 4.3.3\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\n\nAttaching package: 'plotly'\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nThe following object is masked from 'package:ggplot2':\n\n    last_plot\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nThe following object is masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nThe following object is masked from 'package:graphics':\n\n    layout\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nWarning: package 'dplyr' was built under R version 4.3.3\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nRows: 51 Columns: 3\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr (3): State, abbrev, code\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 387 × 5\n# Groups:   State [47]\n   State          year code  total_shootings hover           \n   <chr>         <int> <chr>           <int> <chr>           \n 1 Colorado       1999 CO                  9 Colorado: 9     \n 2 Louisiana      1999 LA                 13 Louisiana: 13   \n 3 Georgia        1999 GA                 12 Georgia: 12     \n 4 Pennsylvania   1999 PA                 17 Pennsylvania: 17\n 5 Massachusetts  1999 MA                  3 Massachusetts: 3\n 6 New Mexico     1999 NM                  7 New Mexico: 7   \n 7 Oklahoma       1999 OK                  4 Oklahoma: 4     \n 8 Florida        2000 FL                 24 Florida: 24     \n 9 California     2000 CA                 40 California: 40  \n10 Illinois       2000 IL                 17 Illinois: 17    \n# ℹ 377 more rows\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n### question: how can gun violence be prevented in schools?\n- what factors affect gun violence?\n- can these factors be used to reduce occurances?\n\n### View Details of Each School Shooting\n\n```{=html}\n<iframe height=\"400\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://cassiegoe2.shinyapps.io/timeline_app/\"> </iframe>\n```\n\n\n## Addressing the Epidemic: Factors and Solutions\nAs we confront the alarming rise in school shootings, it becomes imperative to understand the factors driving this disturbing trend and to explore effective strategies for prevention. Merely acknowledging the grim reality of these incidents is not enough; we must also delve deeper into the root causes, systemic failures, and societal factors that contribute to the epidemic of school shootings. By examining these factors, we can identify areas for intervention and develop evidence-based solutions to prevent further tragedies. So, what are the factors that have contributed to the rise in school shootings and what more can be done to prevent further occurrences?\n\n\n### School Environment \n\n```{=html}\n<iframe height=\"600\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://cassiegoe.shinyapps.io/schoolenv_app/\"> </iframe>\n```\n\n\n### Race\ntreemap (DONE)\n- each rectangle rep an incident; size of rectangle represents number of causalties \n- sub prop of rectangle rep prop of students race in the school \n- show how proportion of race in a school will influence severity/ number of shootings \n\n### Personal Motivations\n\n```{=html}\n<iframe height=\"700\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://cassiegoe2.shinyapps.io/personal_app/\"> </iframe>\n```\n\n\n### Age \n\n```{=html}\n<iframe height=\"600\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://cassiegoe.shinyapps.io/age_app/\"> </iframe>\n```\n\n\n### Access to Firearms\n\n```{=html}\n<iframe height=\"1200\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://cassiegoe.shinyapps.io/access_app/\"> </iframe>\n```\n\n\n### Time \n\n```{=html}\n<iframe height=\"1200\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://cassiegoe2.shinyapps.io/time_app/\"> </iframe>\n```\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\n",
