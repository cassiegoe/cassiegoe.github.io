The Columbine High School shooting in Colorado left 15 people dead and 21 wounded. Moving forward, the number of school shootings in the US have been on the rise and have been the highest recorded in 2022. By analyzing the data on school shootings, it allows for a comprehensive understanding of the frequency, severity, and characteristic of these incidents. This is essential for identifying patterns, trends and underlying factors that contribute to school shootings. Moreover, this information can inform policy decisions and prevention strategies to reduce the occurrence and impact of school shootings.\n\n### Dataset\n\nLink to dataset: \\<<https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joebeachcapital/school-shootings?resource=download>\\>\n\nCSV file: \\[Download CSV file\\](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/tt3qc4dd9zwoqkysua9lh/school-shootings-data.csv?rlkey=nkirxyg4frvkh2kns81bnxvs6&dl=0)\n\n\n```{=html}\n<iframe height=\"400\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://cassiegoe.shinyapps.io/shooting_app/\"> </iframe>\n```\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncat('<img src=\"gun_violence_peace.gif\" width=\"800\" height=\"350\">')\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n<img src=\"gun_violence_peace.gif\" width=\"800\" height=\"350\">\n```\n:::\n:::\n",
