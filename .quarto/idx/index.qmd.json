The Columbine High School shooting in Colorado left 15 people dead and 21 wounded. This tragic event served as a catalyst for heightened awareness and scrutiny of gun violence in schools, setting the stage for ongoing efforts to address the issue. Fast forward to the present day, the alarming rise in the number of school shootings in the United States has reached unprecedented levels, underscoring the urgent need for effective strategies to prevent these tragic incidents. In 2022 alone, the nation witnessed a staggering 46 school shootings, marking the highest number of recorded incidents since 1999. This statistic paints a grim picture of the pervasive threat of gun violence in educational settings and its devastating impact on students, teachers, and communities across the country. \n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [1], gun-related injuries have emerged as the leading cause of death among children and teens in the US. However, beyond the physical injuries, these incidents also inflict long-lasting psychological trauma on students who have directly experienced a school shooting. The prevalence of anxiety and trauma stemming from the threat of school shootings has not only compromised the well-being of students but also disrupted their academic learning through increased absenteeism and decline in students’ academic performance following such incidents.\n\n### View Details of Each School Shooting\n```{=html}\n<iframe height=\"400\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://cassiegoe2.shinyapps.io/timeline_app/\"> </iframe>\n```\n\n## Addressing the Epidemic: Factors\nAs we confront the alarming rise in school shootings, it becomes imperative to understand the factors driving this disturbing trend and to explore effective strategies for prevention. Merely acknowledging the grim reality of these incidents is not enough; we must also delve deeper into the root causes, systemic failures, and societal factors that contribute to the epidemic of school shootings. By examining these factors, we can identify areas for intervention and develop evidence-based solutions to prevent further tragedies. \n\nTo address this issue, we can explore the following questions to gain a deeper insight: \n\n * What are the common motivations and patterns observed among school shooters?\n- What factors could have contributed to the rise in school shootings?\n- How can understanding these factors help to prevent future occurrences?\n\n### Location\n```{=html}\n<iframe height=\"480\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://cassiegoe2.shinyapps.io/choropleth_app/\"> </iframe>\n```\nCalifornia, Texas, and Florida stand out with the highest total number of school shooting incidents recorded between 1999 and 2023. In contrast, Wyoming, West Virginia, Vermont, and Maine were the only states that did not experience any school shooting events during this timeframe. However, it is essential to contextualize these findings by considering the population distribution across states. California, Texas, and Florida happen to be the top three most populous states in the US. This demographic aspect could potentially influence the higher incidence rates of shootings observed in these states.\n\n### School Environment \n```{=html}\n<iframe height=\"430\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://cassiegoe.shinyapps.io/schoolenv_app/\"> </iframe>\n```\nThe data suggests a stark contrast between public and private schools in terms of the frequency of shooting incidents. Public schools appear to be significantly more susceptible to such events compared to their private counterparts. This could be attributed to the differing school climates between private and public schools. Schools with inadequate student-teacher bonding, low student engagement in school activities, and a culture that tolerates disrespect and lacks security measures exhibited elevated levels of school shootings [2]. In   private schools, individual tutors were common and a lower student to teacher ratio was found, with greater positive interactions between student and teachers and after school programs for students were also more prevalent [3]. Additionally,the presence of a resource officer emerges as a significant factor influencing the occurrence of school shootings. Schools with a resource officer on-site tend to experience fewer shooting incidents. This observation underscores the potential role of resource officers in enhancing school safety and mitigating the risk of potential threats on campus.\n\n### Situational Factors\n```{=html}\n<iframe height=\"990\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://cassiegoe2.shinyapps.io/personal_app/\"> </iframe>\n```\n\n### Demographic Factors\n\n#### Race\n```{=html}\n<iframe height=\"400\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://cassiegoe2.shinyapps.io/race_app/\"> </iframe>\n```\nGiven that targeted shootings are the predominant type, it also prompts the question: Could these incidents be racially driven? It appears that schools with a predominantly white student body have encountered the highest number of shootings, as evident from the greater number of squares representing each racial group. Additionally, they also appear to have the highest number of casualties, indicated by the size of each racial group's representation. However, while the data suggests a correlation between the racial demographics of schools and the frequency and severity of shootings, it does not definitively establish a causal relationship. To gain deeper insights into the potential role of racial factors in school shootings, additional analysis is necessary. This includes understanding the specific targets of the shootings and delving into the motivations driving each individual shooter. By examining these aspects more closely, we can better ascertain the extent to which racial factors may contribute to the occurrence of school shootings.\n\n#### Age \n```{=html}\n<iframe height=\"420\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://cassiegoe.shinyapps.io/age_app/\"> </iframe>\n```\n\n### Access to Firearms\n```{=html}\n<iframe height=\"1200\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://cassiegoe.shinyapps.io/access_app/\"> </iframe>\n```\n\n### Time \n```{=html}\n<iframe height=\"400\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://cassiegoe2.shinyapps.io/time_app/\"> </iframe>\n```\nThe majority of school shooting incidents tend to occur during the school day, typically between 7 am and 3 pm, coinciding with regular class hours. While shootings are scattered throughout these hours, no discernible patterns emerge regarding specific timings. However, delving deeper into individual school schedules could unveil correlations between timing of attacks and the current period. For instance, more shootings could happen during lunch periods due to lower levels of supervision. However, despite the dispersed nature of school shootings, a peak emerges, with the highest concentration of incidents occurring at 12 pm.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n## References\n[1] https://www-cdc-gov.libproxy1.nus.edu.sg/violenceprevention/firearms/firearm-research-findings.html#:~:text=Taking%20into%20account%20all%20types,19%20in%202020%20and%202021.\n\n[2]Wike, T.
