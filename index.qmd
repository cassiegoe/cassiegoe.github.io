### Self Introduction 

On April 20, 1999, the deadliest high school shooting occurred at that time in the United States, sparking a national debate on gun control. The Columbine High School shooting in Colorado left 15 people dead and 21 wounded. Moving forward, the number of school shootings in the US have been on the rise and have been the highest recorded in 2022. By analyzing the data on school shootings, it allows for a comprehensive understanding of the frequency, severity, and characteristic of these incidents. This is essential for identifying patterns, trends and underlying factors that contribute to school shootings. Moreover, this information can inform policy decisions and prevention strategies to reduce the occurrence and impact of school shootings.
